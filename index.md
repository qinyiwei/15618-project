# Parallelizing Dynamic Adaptive General Graph Neural Network 

## Summary
We are going to implement a parallel dynamic adaptive graph neural network on NVIDIA GPUs. Our network is different from a traditional neural network in two ways: 1) it is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), 2) computation units in the graph can be added (or pruned) dynamically during training, which makes it harder to parallelize.
